# maze_generator
This is a C++ maze generator using recursive backtracking algorithm and SDL2.</br>
The starting point is at the top left corner and the finish point is at the bottom right corner.
Once the player hits the finish point, a new maze game starts, and the game is on until the player hits the 'X' at the top right corner. </br>
